\begin{abstract}
In collaborative tagging systems, it is generally assumed that users assign tags to facilitate retrieval of content at a later time. There is, however, little behavioral evidence that tags actually serve this purpose. Using a large-scale dataset from the social music website Last.fm, we explore here how patterns of music tagging and subsequent listening interact in an effort to determine if there exist measurable signals of tags functioning as retrieval aids. Specifically, we describe several methods for testing if the assignment of a tag tends to lead to an increase in listening behavior. Results indicate \ldots
