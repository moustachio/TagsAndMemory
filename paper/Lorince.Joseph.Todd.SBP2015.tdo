\contentsline {todo}{Why do we have to log transform this one? Just for comparison, wouldn't the straight (normalized) means be fine?}{5}
\contentsline {todo}{Probably need to say something about the CIs here, if we leave them in, or else otherwise justify that this is a meaningful difference}{6}
\contentsline {todo}{Okay, here's where you can insert your description of the regression mode/results, to make sure I don't muck it up}{6}
\contentsline {todo}{I want a concise, clear nugget of the takeaway from the regression results, but want to be 100\% sure on the results first. I'm assuming it will boil down to some thing like ``...conclude that tagging leads to a small, but significant effect on future listening amount to $\sim $ 2 more listens in the post-tag period than we would expect in the absence of the tag''. Something along those lines}{6}
\contentsline {todo}{What was your p-value here? 0.05? Also not sure how much extra detail on the regression model is needed here, as it's basically the same as what we describe in the previous section}{6}
\contentsline {todo}{It seems like it would be nice to have a full listing of the tags and coefficients for people to look at, but of course listing it untenable...maybe we link to it in a footnote? Or not worthi it?}{7}
\contentsline {todo}{I think we should plot this against global tag popularity (i.e. from the full dataset..probably log popularity though). I doubt the shape will be different, but I think that's more appropriate here. I can do this easiy once I have the final list of significant tags. Agreed? By the time you see this I'll have pushed a file to git with these global frequencies.}{7}
\contentsline {todo}{Need to think through this section a bit more, once results are a bit more finalized, but the following chunk definitely should be in there (though certainly with some edits).}{8}
\contentsline {todo}{Need to talk about limitations, both of methods, and of course that we're talking just about one system...could be different on, say, Delicious, but we don't yet have to test it}{8}
